# NTS bot

This is a community project based around creating a more accessible public data archive for [NTS radio](https://www.nts.live/), the largest community radio station in the world.

In repository, you will find:

- the raw data of each NTS show (see `tracklist/`).
- an interesting case study in multilingual data matching across datasources: specifically the NTS archive matched against spotify.
- the project also used to do youtube, but the youtube API needs some work before it can handle the amount data used within this project.

You can find the published output of this project here:

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31yeoenly5iu5pvoatmuvt7i7ksy).
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@nts-bot).
- [Most played tracks](./most_played_tracks.txt).
- [Most played artists](./most_played_artists.txt).

This is open source, so hopefully what you do with it is also.
