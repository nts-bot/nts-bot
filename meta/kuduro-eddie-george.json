    },
    "description": "Kuduro is the electronic dance music of a generation born and raised during Angola's traumatic and protracted civil war. It started life on Angola's margins, in the clubs and ghettos of the nation's capital, Luanda, before being co-opted by the government to become the official, state sanctioned sound of post-war Angola. \nBroadcaster and music obsessive Edward George takes us on a journey through the social history of Kuduro. He looks at what this insistently joyous club music can tell us about the relationship of dance music to the machinations of state power, and what is left unsaid both during and in the aftermath of the civil war.\nThis series was commissioned for Counterflows Festival 2021 / 2022 \nFor more podcasts, films and articles by Counterflows head here:\nhttps://counterflows.com/",
