    "description": "In 1977, the Voyager spacecraft launched with two golden phonograph records, containing a variety of sounds and images selected to best represent life on earth, in the hopes that they might be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThis year marks the 45th anniversary of the Voyager records' launch into the cosmos. But if we were to do it all again today, what would we do differently?\nThis four hour broadcast contains the original NASA-collated mix of sounds, followed by a two hour mix of NTS listener-submitted sounds.
