    "description": "During 'Wave Form', Aurélien Arbet and Pierre Rousseau explore an interpolation of various recordings, often at the margins of traditional formats and conventional styles of music. During an hour, a long oscillation is formed out of a selection of interviews, spoken word, poetry, music for dance or art, marginal pop attempts and various field recordings.\nAurélien Arbet is an art director, co-founder of the clothing brand and publishing house Études. Pierre Rousseau is a composer, producer and sound designer, crafting sounds for records, films, and art projects.",
