    "description": "NTS links with LA's Hammer Museum, traversing jazz through the eyes of Kentucky-born artist Bob Thompson, whose sumptuous and colourful painting took rich inspiration from the music of his peers. Influenced by the post-bop and free jazz futurism of friends Charlie Haden and Ornette Coleman as equally as Renaissance painter legends, Thompson's paintings are febrile with the potential energy of free improvisation. \nThis three-part series acts as an introduction to Thompson, and explores the sounds of his influences, featuring insights and panel discussion from Hammer Museum's Erin Christovale with Ashon Crawley and Dr.Kellie Jones and others.",
