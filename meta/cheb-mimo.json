    "description": "\"Shakshouka\" is a dialectal arabic word used in North Africa to reflect an unexpected mixture of elements that wouldn’t naturally go together.\nThis radio show encapsulates this idea by showcasing how maghrebian sonorities blend with other influences from reggae, dance-pop to hip hop, all under the spectrum of Raï, taking you through a musical journey of one-of-a-kind melodies.",
