    "description": "The after effects of the UK's brief and furious punk explosion were numerous and irreversible. Most impactful was not it's effect on aesthetic, or sound, but its effect on attitude. \nThousands of bands from every corner of the UK took inspiration from punk's distain for the contemporary pop rulebook, and broke out in hundreds of new musical directions, usually remaining independent and suspicious of the UK industry apparatus. \nThis series uncovers the immediate post-punk era in the UK – from roughly the end of the 1970s, to the end of the '80s – highlighting pillars of the scene, overlooked regional offshoots, compilation-scoured rarities and more, in a survey of one of the most creative moments in British music history.
