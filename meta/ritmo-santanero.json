    "description": "Ritmo Santanero is an all-vinyl cumbia trio based in Santa Ana, CA consisting of DJ’s Rigo Suave, Gary Ventura and LX Ramirez. The revered cumbia connoisseurs locally dubbed “Los Tres Reyes Cumbieros” are each seasoned vinyl collectors in their own right. Their highly-curated selection ranges from porros, gaitas, rebajadas, to rare tracks and beloved classics - all on 45s.\nRitmo Santanero stands out as an artistic contender in the Southern California sonidero scene as the trio expands out of Santa Ana and into Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Oxnard - bringing the best all-vinyl cumbia night to a town near you. Spinning a mix of cumbia genres from of all corners of the world, Ritmo Santanero is reviving the once-dormant sonidero culture of the 90’s, yet deviating from the announcement-heavy tradition by letting the music do the talking.\nwww.instagram.com/ritmosantanero",
