    "description": "In this four part radio series, NTS celebrates the women of British reggae, combining insights from the past and voices of the present to explore the history of reggae from a female perspective.\nWhen reggae is spoken about culturally, it often centres the voices of male producers, artists, and engineers. This broadcast dives deep into the experience of the women who have been a part of the genesis of reggae and its myriad offshoots, and some contemporary female perspectives on this rich and influential genre. \nAcross four episodes, we highlight women of the movement, whose lyricism and musicality created the bedrock of the genre - from pirate radio to sound system culture, dancehall, and lovers rock.",
