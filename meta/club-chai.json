    "description": "CLUB CHAI is a record label, event series and curatorial project founded by 8ULENTINA and FOOZOOL (Lara Sarkissian) in Oakland, California. CLUB CHAI centers diasporic artists with the intention of carving out sounds and spaces that consider the ways we build narratives as a reflection of our current and future selves. We believe in the transformative abilities of storytelling through sound and honoring its creation of genres and movements for marginalized people throughout the history of electronic music. Through our label releases and projects we hope to contribute to this archive and history. \nCLUB CHAI hosts regular events in Oakland and San Francisco while participating in an international network of artists and collaborators. CLUB CHAI holds regular showcases in New York City and London, and have also presented at Unsound Festival Krakow (2019), Mexico City, Milan, and a UK tour in collaboration with TT label. The label hosts shows and streams on NTS radio, Rinse FM, Lower Grand Radio, and Boiler Room.",
