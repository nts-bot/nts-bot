    "description": "The natural world is dominated by rhythm â€“ from the daily back-and-forth bounce of the tides, to the intricate swing of birdsong. Humans are, of course, part of the natural world. Taking inspiration from the elements, this four part series explores drumming and percussion from around the world, past and present.\nWe begin with the aqueous, natural sounds of water drumming and dried fruit percussion. Next we dig into the earthen rumble of tribal and folk rhythms, followed by the unbridled fire of improvised jazz performance. And finally, we close with the ethereal, futuristic patterns of synthesised percussion.",
