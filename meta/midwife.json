    "description": "Midwife’s multi-instrumentalist and recording engineer Madeline Johnston presents “Machines of Loving Grace,” a monthly transmission featuring her new finds and old favorites with a focus on the golden age of DIY community, cosmic sentimentalism, world music, and experimental pop. “Machines of Loving Grace” is a gateway into Johnston’s process and personal soundtrack.\nInspired by the Richard Brautigan poem, Midwife’s curated playlists explore the idea of “a cybernetic ecology;” acoustic and electronic sources reflect on our humanity as well as our animalistic nature in the context of a digital landscape.
