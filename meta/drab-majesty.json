    "description": "Channel 39 is a sonic respite from the aural and visual chaos of today - a peaceful hour of reflection and contemplation, esoteric excerpts, and poetry readings set to the ethereal backdrop of a carefully curated playlist consisting of legendary ambient and new age artists spanning from the 1960's to present. In a time of such unrest and stress, it is important that we allow ourselves the space to turn inward and point our consciousness to the void.",
